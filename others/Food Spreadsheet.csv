3,Affogato ,Dessert,Tascas,yes,"For the uninitiated affogato is a scoop of vanilla ice cream ‘drowned’ in a shot of hot espresso.  This is combines two of my favourite things, ice cream and coffee. Provided the coffee (and ice cream) are of high quality this is the ultimate simple dessert.  Tascas does this quite well and has earned a rating of four stars.",4
4,Sushi ,Lunch,St Pierres,no,To be fair I had this a *very* long time ago but still remember it as being too much rice and not nearly enough other fillings – so much so that I won’t go there again.,2
5,Lamb Kebab,Dinner,Ephesus Turkish Kitchen,no,"This is one of my favourite ‘eating out’ dinners.  The combination of flat bread, humus, lettuce, lamb and other random ingredients is really, really, good.  The only slight “problem” is that the portion size is extremely generous which generally means having no room left for dessert.",4
6,Chicken Fillet Sub ,Lunch,Subway,no,"The good thing about Subway is the choice when it comes to bread, salads and fillings.  I’m somewhat ambivalent when it comes to the chicken sub – its ‘OK’ but a six-inch is not enough, and a twelve inch is way too much.  I like that the sandwich has less than six grams of fat, but I just can’t get all that excited over what is basically a chicken sandwich.",3
7,French Toast ,Breakfast,Home,yes,The trick to this one is to use homemade raison bread (instead of shop-bought white / brown bread) and be generous with the amount of syrup / cinnamon and sugar added on the top.  Provided the egg is properly cooked this is the ultimate in decadent breakfasts. It is a once a year treat that is totally worth every calorie.,5
8,Sushi ,Lunch,Sushi Ya,no,"This is probably the best sushi shop in Auckland.  The prices are reasonable, the pieces are generously sized and the ratio of rice to filling is perfect (ie: loads of filling with a relatively small amount of rice).  They have a surprisingly large range for the size of the shop and their salmon / tuna sushi is particularly good.",5
9,Tuna Salad ,Lunch,Home,no,"This one involves a large bowl of lettuce, avocado, salad dressing and smoked tinned tuna.  It’s healthy and surprisingly filling but if I’m honest, it’s not all that inspiring. It tastes OK provided the lettuce is fresh, but it is nowhere near as nice as other options that are out there.  The upside is that it is quick and easy to assemble.",3
10,Blind Scouse ,Lunch,Home,yes,"This is one of those ‘make it in advance’, freeze it and then eat it jobs.  It’s a stew made of potato, carrots, lentils and spices. The good thing about it is that it quick to reheat, healthy and filling.  Having said that, it is not something you’d want to eat everyday, as it can be a bit boring.",3
